# POMODORO-APP
Classic pomodoro timer used to concentrate during study sessions.

DISCLAIMER: This is not very professional but I'm young and funny so whatever. The timer is an app built for a friend that had trouble finishing his master's final project that's why it does not work normally. 

I need to update the onClicks events related to the panel but for now appreciate the beautiful interface.

In order to use it the right way just reset (click the arrow) it first and voil√†.
